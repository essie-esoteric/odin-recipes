   <p>I grew up not liking meatloaf, but as it turns out, this is because the meatloaf I had growing up was bad. I'm pretty sure it was just straight up meat + ketchup + bread... </p>
   <p>Anyways, I finally decided trying to make it on my own but butter and I was looking at some recipes and found a couple that had different attributes I liked and decided to combine them with good results!</p>
   <p>This meatloaf has so much flavor, I really love it. It's pretty easy to throw together and it's such an easy thing to make a lot of and reheat for left-overs. Here is what you need:</p>
   <h3>Ingredients:</h5>
   <ul>
        <li>2 lbs ground beef, (preferably 85% or 90% lean)</li>
        <li>1 med onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp worcestershire</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce Ingredients:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F</li>
        <li>Mix up all the ingredients (keeping the sauce separate). I just throw it all into a big bowl and use my hands, but I have heard of people using a large resealable plastic bag by putting in the ingredients, sealing it and kneading it. How you do it is up to you!</li>
        <li>Put meat mixture into a 9"x5" bread pan</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes</li>
        <li>After 40 minutes has passed, take it out and spread the sauce out over the top</li>
        <li>Bake an additional 15-20 minutes or until internal temp reaches 160°F.</li>
        <li>Cool 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
